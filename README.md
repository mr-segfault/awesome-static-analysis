> Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs â€” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)

This is a collection of static analysis tools and code quality checkers starting with this list: https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis and improving it (by removing outdated projects and unrealistically expensive commercial tools). Further, some tools had limited functionality that other tools might have excelled at; choice adjustments were made to limit the number of tool functionality overlap.
